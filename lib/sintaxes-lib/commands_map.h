/**
 * This file should have the definitions of commands and it's arguments
 * A news protocol is being developed for message communication between
 * devices with less 2KB RAM.
 * 
 * It'Å› built in top of MessagePack, but no strings allowed. That's why
 * we need definition of this constants on both sides, server appliance side
 * and embedded side. The embedded side receives the new 6Bytes-msgpack message
 * which is able to receive maps and array of maps all based on this constants.
 * 
 * Both side must share the same constants.
 * 
 * All constants get packed as uint32_t which is 8bytes, so for a convenience
 * functions arguments can use 6 bytes of a 8 bytes words, since until 0xff is
 * reserved for messagePack itself. 
 * 
 * All commands are executed as per received data on the fly, so we need:
 *      1 - validate COMMAND it self;
 *      2 - validate and buffer ALL ARGS for each COMMAND it self, we can tune this by 
 *          increasing or decreasing the number of args BUFFER
 *      3 - one command is executed per time and response is being generated on the fly as well
 *          TODO: a response interruption to write the proper error response
 *      4 - All state of the ALL Module should be always update same time more then once on one
 *          loop() execution in a STATE BUFFER with msgpacked serialization
 *      5 - Before any execution save the STATE BUFFER as previous state so we can rollback if there's
 *          a command execution error
 *      6 - All COMMAND communication response must include the OLD STATE and the new STATE msgpack 
 * 
 * Besides messagePack this constants as uint32_t we should define them as hex
